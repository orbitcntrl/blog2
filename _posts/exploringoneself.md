I want to explore and navigate the memories that have shaped who I am—-my system of consciousness, the construct of "self."

Through this practice, I aim to sketch an inner diagram, a map, a cartography (call it what you will) that conceptualizes my consciousness as a whole—not from an instrumentalist or medical perspective, but from a deeply personal and philosophical one.

I constantly question myself: Is intelligence merely a construct we’ve created in our attempt to understand ourselves? Are we truly intelligent? Is consciousness exclusive to living organisms, or does it extend beyond—perhaps into crystals? And what about emotions—are they just chemical reactions, or do they hold intrinsic meaning?

Why is it difficult for me to connect with people in the ways they expect? Why do simple gestures—hugs, smiles—feel unnatural to me?

Can I draw a line between these aspects of self? And if so, where?

Some aspects of self I wish to explore:

1. Memories and Forgetting

# How my memories shape my identity and what is lost in forgetting. Do I really forget? or is the memory in a secret mental compartment? 

# I have the sensation I've forgottten really important and meaningful experiences, that I then, remember on a random moment.

# As I travel and explore other cultures, and my own, I realize that my memories and experiences are similar, yet so different to Others. 

2. Dreams and Imagination

# The unconscious-self and its role in shaping reality. 

# I remember my first experience trying dimethyltryptamine, the psychedelic compound found in plants, other animals and our brains. I was offered a hit, or two, during my college years. If I actually knew the actual intensity this substance produces, I would actually not do it; kidding, I'd do it again. The hallucinogenic experience--to call  it something--that I had, felt like a dream, but also, reality as in-merged with the Universe, or the fabric of reality itself. I experienced ego dissolution, as if I literally merged with it all around me, and my sense of self dissapeared. I saw infinite geometric patterns, fractals, and encountered with entities--I call DMT creatures. My perception of time and space was completely altered, seconds felt like minutes or so, and minutes as hours, and so on, and so on.. until a moment in which I started hearing all type of frequencies and waves, and saw the different trees and plants around me vibrating distintively, the sounds were too intense, and then, there was a bright light, and I left. I wasn't Ed anymore. I can't entirely explain my experience, but I can say that is has been the most profound experience I have ever had. It felt like I was pulled into another realm, everything around me was dissolved, everything at incredible speed, like a tunnel full of geometric patterns. The divine DMT creatures were not humanoid at all--instead, they were self-transforming, hyperdimensional fractals, constantly shifting, unfolding, and communicating in ways beyond human understanding. I don't know if they were alive, as we understand life, but they didn't seem organic, or carbon-based, they seemed conscious intelligent outside time, and wouldn't communicate through words, but through symbols, and feelings--like telephatic data-exchange. I must add that not all geometric shapes were familiar, most of them felt completely aliens. I remember waking up from the DMT breakthrough thinking I saw angels, and met the Architect. Of course, I shared some of it, but kept the rest. I didn't want to sound insane. But overal, this experience changed my beliefs, and my values. It was as-if somehow I downloaded a repository of information from the dmt-cloud I needed, in order to connect with other humans and nonhuman animals, and understand my love for them, for the World, for the creatures on Earth, for life in general, for the unknown, my curiosity, and myself.

3. Body and Sensations

# How physical experiences inform our body a sense of self.

# The body is often seen as a vessel, but actually, is the first and most intimate map of selfness. It collects, interprets, and reacts to the world in ways the mind will not always be able to articulate. There are sensations that are fleeting yet profound; they can and will trigger memories, alter our moods, and even shape and shapeshift our sense of self and identity.

# Where does my body end and the external world begin?

# How does my body shapes the way I experience the world?

# Do I feel at home in my own flesh and bone? ifnot, what's stopping me from feeling cozy in my own body?

# Which sensations transport me to the past? Scents of certain flowers and the taste of avocados--We used to have a really big avocado tree at my father's house; and we would go to the roof of the house to get access to the avocados, specially during Summer. It was beautiful, sunny, vibrant, colorful. But there are other sensations, like the smell of mint, green apple, and vanilla, reminds me of my dead brother. Sometimes it makes my heart beat faster than usual, and probably cry. And other times, it makes me want to remember him well, just him, playing with me, when we were kids.

# Are there pysical sensations I associate with comfort? with fear? The sensation of cool weather, not too cold, not hot, not too humid, but defintely not dry XD--That's the best sensation--pure comfort, even more points if there is another body next to me, just a friend, a family member, or a lover, just someone to share words with. The sensation of touching reptiles is something I fear--To primitive and primal of me, I know! but I can't deal with Reptiles, I might lose some points and auras for this, but it's ok. 

# What does pain teach us about our limits? I haven't experienced anything more painful than losing my dear brother. When I received a phonecall from my aunt, to tell me: "Your brother left"; I was all alone, in a parking lot, I felt my whole body fall on the ground. I couldn't stop crying. I couldn't stop the sensation. It felt as-if my body was being ripped apart as I kept trying to rip all the grass around me, with my bare hands, all alone. "I've gone through that, I know how you're feeling", "Not everything goes around your grief", "Are you still grieving?", "How did he die?"

# Now, talking about pain, in other parts of the body, the grief was such, that a few months later, I started exercising, and working at festivals, nonstop, I would just work, work, see his face in other people's faces, and I would try to disasociate, talk as little as possible. And then, I started experiencing another type of pain, it was coming from different muscles and parts of my intergumentary system. I was making myself stronger, and my mental health was getting sharper. Exercising and working physically in the way I was during those months-years, made me a stronger person, mentally and physically; pain is gain.

4. Patterns & Habits (mapping the repetition of the self)

# Patterns and habits form the structure of our daily lives, shaping our behavior, identity, and even our perception of time. They can be conscious or unconsious, helpful or self-destructive. Exploring them means understanding the loop we find ourselves in--Why do I repeat certain behaviors and how they influence my sense of self?

5. Relational Network

# Our sense of self doesn't exist in isolation--it's shaped by the relationships we form, the roles we play, and the spaces we occupy in the lives of others. How do I connect with other? what patterns emerge in those interactions? and how these relationships reflect or distort my self-perception? Think of: Family bonds, friendships, romantic and intimate, social circles and acquaintances, online interactions, professional/academic ties, self relationship, lost connections, etc.

6. Desires

7. Contradictions(9) 

# The tensions between who I am, who I want to be, and who I appear to be to Others.
